Hello, I'm a developer and I like to code.I'm good at Laravel,React,Nextjs,Typescript.
I'm trying to learn Astro and I'm trying to make a blog with it and I'm trying this theme because it's very beautiful and I like it.
I'll make changes to entire theme in the future but as of now let it be... looks good.

I did try to make my own however since I'm new so I couldn't make it work.Especially the Astro.props() function was giving me a hard time.Once I understand it I'll either make my own or change this theme to the point where it's not recognizable.
